      <h4>Welcome to Petta Group</h4><br>
        <p>Our research focuses on quantum control of nanometer scale systems. Semiconductor quantum dots are used to isolate single electron spins, 
          which exhibit long quantum coherence times. These systems allow quantum mechanics to be harnessed in a solid state environment for the 
          implementation of quantum gates. We use nanofabrication to create artificially structured systems with experimentally tunable Hamiltonians
          that can be controlled on sub-nanosecond timescales. Recent research examines strong light-matter interactions in the circuit quantum 
          electrodynamics architecture, with a goal of generating long-range many body entanglement. Silicon and diamond are ideal host materials 
          for spin coherence, leading to spin coherence times that now approach 10 seconds. A major effort in the group consists of developing a 
          scalable quantum computing architecture in isotopically purified silicon. Research advances are enabled by a tight feedback loop that 
          links nanoscale materials synthesis and advanced transport measurements.</p>
